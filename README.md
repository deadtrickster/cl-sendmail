# CL-Sendmail portability project #

CL-Sendmail was written by Robert Marlow, as a rewrite of
the sendmail.lisp code by Christophe Rhodes.
This is a fork of the copy of version 0.5.5 from
        <http://www.bobturf.org/software/cl-sendmail/>

In this fork we strive for improved portability, in particular
we need Allegro Common Lisp compatibility.
