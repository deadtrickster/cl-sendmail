cl-sendmail is a hack of Christophe Rhodes' sendmail.lisp file found
at
http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~csr21/lisp/sendmail.lisp

It depends on the software found at
these locations:
http://files.b9.com/cl-base64/cl-base64-latest.tar.gz
http://www.bobturf.org/software/cl-mime/
http://common-lisp.net/project/xmls/
http://www.bobturf.org/software/xmls-tools/


It works with SBCL and thanks to Tim Howe it should now partially work
with CMUCL
